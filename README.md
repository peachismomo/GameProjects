# GameProjects
Showcase of game projects done at my time in DigiPen with different teams

## HopWards (Year 1 Project)
This game was made using DigiPen's engine, to help students understand the basics of making games.
HopWards is a 2.5D game, inspired by punishment platformer games such as Jump King, Only Up, Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy etc.
The game design was inspired by the moving stairs as well as talking paintings in Harry Potter.
You use WASD to move, spacebar to jump, F to interact with portraits, and the player gets to the top by doing some difficult platforming and puzzle solving by rotating stairs by interacting with paintings.

## Twilight (Year 2 Project)
A 2D top down view game created using a custom engine with a team of 6 programmers and 2 designers using C++ for the engine and embedded C# for the gameplay.
TwiLight is a Top-Down, 2D Puzzle Adventure Game, where you play as Elio, a boy who wakes up in a mysterious dungeon, trying to escape with the help of a magical fire sprite, Dara.
The main mechanic of the game is the lighting emitted by the player based on the item he is holding which can interact with some of the environment to solve puzzles and escape the dungeon.
The lighting mechanic is done using shaders to emulate 2D lighting without a 3D environment, involving both illumination and shadows.
