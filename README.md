# GameProjects
Showcase of game projects done at my time in DigiPen with different teams

## HopWards (Year 1 Project)
HopWards was created using DigiPen's engine to introduce students to the basics of game development. This 2.5D platformer draws inspiration from challenging titles like Jump King, Only Up, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, but with a unique twist. The game incorporates the puzzle-solving element of rotating stairs, drawing inspiration from magical moving staircases and talking portraits, reminiscent of the world in Harry Potter.

Gameplay:
- Use WASD to move, Spacebar to jump, and F to interact with magical portraits.
- Navigate difficult platforming sections and solve puzzles by rotating stairs through interactions with paintings.

## Twilight (Year 2 Project)
Twilight is a top-down, 2D puzzle adventure game built using a custom engine. Developed by a team of 6 programmers and 2 designers, the project leverages C++ for engine development and C# for gameplay scripting. The game features a unique lighting mechanic that is central to puzzle-solving and advancing through its mysterious dungeon.
Story:
- Play as Elio, a boy who wakes up in an enigmatic dungeon and seeks to escape with the help of a magical fire sprite, Dara.
- The lighting mechanic is integral to the gameplay, where the light from the item the player holds interacts with the environment to reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles.
